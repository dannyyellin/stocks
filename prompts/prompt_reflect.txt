Examine the error messages given above.   For at most 5 errors, provide an explanation of (a) where the faulty code is
located, (b) what the error is, and (c) how to fix it.  Your explanation should be precise so that a programmer
can follow your instructions and correct the errors.   Do not consider Warnings or the fact that the container
is not running on a production server.  If there is not enough information in the error messages, then consider which
tests failed and examine the code to determine what changes to the code are needed.   Think what may have caused the
error, including preceding requests.  For example, a GET request may return a 404 status code if the previous POST
request adding that item failed.
